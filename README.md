### Project 1:- Regression
This project is oriented towards Machine learning techniques. For this project we have selected Absenteeism at work dataset from UCI machine learning repository. The link is as given below.

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Absenteeism+at+work


### Points which we worked on :

1.	To predict absenteeism from work
2.	Based on what information should we predict whether an employee is expected to be absent or not.
3.	How to measure Absenteeism.
4.	To know whether or not an employee can be expected to be missing or a for a specific number of hours in a given workday.
5.	To improve decision making by reorganizing work process and increase productivity based on predictions.

#### Our module predicts absenteeism in binary value 0(Not absent from work) and 1(Absent from work)
#### We also analysed which reasons of absence are responsible for absentee from the reasons given in dataset

### Purpose for studying dataset :
1.	To explore whether a person presenting certain characteristics is expected to be away from work at some point in time or not.
2.	To explore for how many working hours an employee could be away from work on information based from dataset like :
3.	How far they live
4.	How many childrenâ€™s and pets they have
5.	Do they have higher education or not
